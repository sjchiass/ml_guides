    "# Week 5, Lecture 9, Tensorflow version\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my first time using TensorFlow, so the code might not be great; however, some of the lessons I've learned as a newbie are fresh in my mind, so they may be useful to you too.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: it's hard to see, but the text below has a few links to the TF documentation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "TF runs things through a [`tf.Session()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Session). When I first booted up this notebook, I was ready to start multiplying matrices NumPy style, but then I realized something was missing: `tf.Session`. You can do some setup before starting the session, but any operation must be pass through `tf.Session().run()` to actually run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other bit of confusion was with using Numpy arrays with TF. It turns out to be relatively easy. At first I thought I needed to [`tf.convert_to_tensor()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/convert_to_tensor), but it turns out that the `feed_dict` method does not like TF.tensors and only likes Numpy (and a few other formats).\n",
    "\n",
    "Feeding the data to the model turned out to be simple, after more confusion. You can feed data to your model using [`feed_dict=`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/how_tos/reading_data/#feeding) and [`tf.placeholder()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/io_ops/placeholders). The `feed_dict` is just a Python dictionary obect with variable names as keys (pointing to placeholders) and data as values. At first this seemed weird, but it really just seems to be you designating a drop-off point or a parking lot for your data. One pleasant surprise is that you can also feed a value like a learning rate this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "There you have it. Another beginner example of TensorFlow, this one written by a beginner. I'd like to thank my friends for coming over for some BBQ and some TensorFlow as we tried to make sense of this all.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: the SGD optimizer doesn't work too well. Uncomment the Adam optimizer for a boost in performance!)"
