# ML Guides by sjchiass

These are my personal notes. I try to keep them clean so that I can understand them in the future. Hopefully, they're clean enough that they can be useful to someone else as ML guides.

Since these are personal notes, I won't accept pull requests or other contributions. However, you're free to modify or fork the code as long as you obey the BSD-3 license, especially the non-endorsement part.
