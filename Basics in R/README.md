# rlang_coursera
An R port of the Andrew Ng course

To view these files, download them, open them in RStudio, and `knit` them. The pdfs you can view easily, but the html you'll have to download and open (or view using github's viewer).

If you're working from the command line or console, just run `rmarkdown::render("Week1_Lecture1_Basics.Rmd")`.

### Requirements

RStudio will tell you what you need, but it looks like you need `rmarkdown`, `formatR`, and a LaTeX installtion for the pretty equations.

### Thanks

Have fun!
