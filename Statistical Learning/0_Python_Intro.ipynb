    "# An introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Join the flying Python circus\n",
    "\n",
    "Python started as a hobbyist project in Christmas of '89. Its creator said that he wanted \"a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers\". (ABC was an attempt to make the BASIC programming language less like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC#Examples](broken English in screaming CAPS).)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python looks a lot like pseudo code, code written in a notebook on a hot summer afternoon. For example, `[\"Spoiled!\" if apple[\"spoiled\"] else \"Fresh!\" for apple in bunch]` is an example of Python's looser syntax. It relies more on words and indents than brackets and semi-colon line teminators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is not for everyone. It's a loose and dynamic interpreted programming language. It assumes a lot, more than a language like C++, and it doesn't run especially fast. It is not something you want to use in a high-stakes, high-speed situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has good things going for it. It is able to interface with fast and powerful libraries like Numpy and TensorFlow, giving Python speed without sacrificing friendliness. Python has also been the most popular beginner programming language for quite some time, so it has a good following of beginners and grey-beards alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get you started in python, I'll go over the basics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing libraries** Importing libraries is how you can use pre-written code in Python. If you're doing data science, statistical learning, or deep learning, you'll likely be importing a library. For example, people have already developed TensorFlow to run deep learning models, and you can import TensorFlow into your python project to quickly set up neural networks yourself.\n",
    "2. **Manipulating strings** Strings in python are text. They may a few letters, words, lines, sentences, or a simple report nicely aligned and evenly spaced. You can use tools in python to manipulate strings to your liking or make them more presentable on the screen.\n",
    "3. **Using lists** Lists stores data, but as the name indicates, lists are *lists*. Python can read through them naturally, allowing you to do whatever you want with the items.\n",
    "4. **Using dictionaries** Just like a real dictionary, when you give a dictionary a word, you get something in return, whether it's the definition of a word, the phone number of a person, or the sales value of a product. You may need dictionaries in your project or you might not: dicionaries have their uses.\n",
    "5. **Opening files** Since these guides are targetted to data analysts, it's bound to happen that a fille need opening somewhere. I'll cover opening text files, including CSVs. This should at least get you started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "To import a Python library/package means to include either Python code or some pre-compiled programs into your own Python script. The important thing to keep track of here is the *namespace*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the main things `import` does is include pre-existing code in your python script. This code may be active, or it may be passive. Here's an example of an `import` [that does something](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)."
